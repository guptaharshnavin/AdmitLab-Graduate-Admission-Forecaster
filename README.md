## About The Project
Graduate Admissions are a very intricate process, which include various factors, academic performance, performance in standardized tests, and other profile parameters, on the basis of which it is decided whether the Admission is **Granted or Not**.<br>
The main aim of this project is to **Develop And Compare Performance of Various ML Models** to determine the right model to predict the chances of an individual's Graduate Admission. The project makes use of 7 features to determine the chances of admission.<br>
The various ML Models whose were built and performance compared are as follows:<br>
:one: Linear Regression<br>
:two: KNN Regression<br>
:three: Decision Tree Regression<br>
:four: Random Forest Regression<br>
:five: XGBoost Regression <br> 
The Best Performing model was **XGBoost Regression**. The performance was measured using **Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)**.
